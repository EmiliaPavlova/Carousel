# Infinite Image Carousel

### Technical Assessment Task

Create an infinite image carousel (the items loop when the either end is reached) using React. Navigation inside the carousel should only be triggered by scroll, rather than arrows or buttons.

### Requirements

The component must:
- Work with images of different sizes and aspect ratios
- Work on devices with different screen sizes
- Work on both mobile and desktop
- Work equally well with a dozen of images, as well as 1000+ images
- Be reusable

### Notes

You can use the Picsum list api or any other public api to get the images -

### Starting the project

The project uses React + TypeScript + Vite:
- install: `npm install`
- run: `npm run dev`
